# Movie-Finder-App
Contain files used in creating a web app that allows users to find information about any movie.

# Overview

My software is a movie finder app. This app allows a user to find useful information about any movie of their choice. The movie app makes use of the IMDB API as the source of the information about any movie the user searches. I used HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling and UI. The movie app is running on a JavaScript engine. Some of the features of the movie app includes a search button for searching for movies. It also has a section that displays movies at random for the user to see when the movie page is loaded. 

Beacuse i am a movie fan and also a movie critic, i decided to build this to help other movie lovers like me to find information on any movie of their choice.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, i used VS Code as my IDE, and employed the use of some VS code extensions to maximize my productivity.

I used JavaScript majorly to complete this software. Because it is web-based app, i made use of HTMl for structure and CSS for styling, as well as for DOM structure. I did not make use of any library or framework whilst working on this app. I however made use of some node modules as well as an API.

# Future Work

- I plan to add a create account /sign in to account feature that enables user to create an account and sign in with it whenever they visit the website.

- Subsequently, I plan to include a feature that allows you to bookmark, make a list of movies you would like to see. This feature would be linked to each user's account.
